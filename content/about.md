I'm a fullstack developer @ [devsuit GmbH](https://devsuit.de) since summer 2018. I design and write software mostly in Python and Javascript / Typescript,
using several frameworks such as Django and VueJS, but I have developed with quite a few other languages and frameworks.

After finishing my professional training as an it specialist in system integration, I worked several years for a health insurance.
About three years in the job, I switched internally from maintaining the business software and first/second level support to the development department.

Through my background I have a huge interest in everything else around software.
